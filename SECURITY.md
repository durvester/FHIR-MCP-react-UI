## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### üö® For Security Issues

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainers via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### üìã What to Report

Please report any of the following:

- **Authentication/Authorization bypasses**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issues**
- **Injection vulnerabilities**
- **Sensitive data exposure**
- **Insecure dependencies**

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

This demo application follows these security principles:

#### For Developers Using This Demo

1. **Never use in production** - This is a demo with mock data
2. **Update dependencies** regularly for security patches
3. **Validate all inputs** in real implementations
4. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
5. **Implement proper CORS** policies
6. **Follow OAuth 2.0 security best practices**

#### OAuth 2.0 Security Considerations

- **Use PKCE** for public clients
- **Validate redirect URIs** strictly
- **Implement proper token storage**
- **Use short-lived access tokens**
- **Implement token refresh securely**

#### FHIR Security Guidelines

- **Follow SMART on FHIR** security requirements
- **Implement proper scopes** and permissions
- **Validate FHIR resources** before processing
- **Use TLS 1.2+** for all communications
- **Implement audit logging**

### üîí Demo Limitations

**Important**: This is a demonstration application with the following security limitations:

- **Mock Authentication**: Uses hardcoded demo credentials
- **Client-Side Tokens**: JWT tokens are generated client-side
- **No Real Validation**: Token validation is simulated
- **Hardcoded Data**: Patient data is static and fake
- **No Encryption**: Sensitive data is not encrypted

### üè• Healthcare Data Security

If implementing similar functionality with real healthcare data:

1. **HIPAA Compliance**: Ensure all PHI handling meets HIPAA requirements
2. **Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit
3. **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls
4. **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive audit logs
5. **Data Minimization**: Only access necessary data
6. **Consent Management**: Implement proper patient consent workflows

### ü§ù Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate security researchers who:

- **Report vulnerabilities responsibly**
- **Allow reasonable time** for fixes before disclosure
- **Provide clear reproduction steps**
- **Suggest potential mitigations**

### üìû Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- Check existing security advisories
- Review this security policy for updates
